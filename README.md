# Task List Manager

This project involves creating a simple Todo List application using React. The application allows users to manage tasks by **adding**, **editing**, **marking as completed**, and **deleting** them. Each task has a status (completed or incomplete) and a priority (low, medium, high), represented by different colors. The app includes functionalities for task management and display, utilizing local storage to persist tasks across page refreshes.

## Features

### Task Management

- **Task List Display**: Displays tasks with their status and options to mark as completed or delete. Includes counters for total and completed tasks.

- **Task Management**: Allows adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting tasks.

- **Local Storage**: Persists tasks locally to maintain data integrity even after page refreshes.

### Technical Considerations

- State Management: Utilizes React hooks for state management (e.g., useState, useEffect).

- Styling: Styling can be done using CSS or frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

- Special Challenge: Implements a basic filtering system based on task priority.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness of Functionality: Ensures all functionalities work as expected.

- Code Clarity and Organization: Maintains clear and organized code structure.

- Responsive Design: Ensures the application is responsive across different devices.

- Styling and User Interface: Provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

- Proper Use of React Hooks and State Management: Utilizes React hooks effectively for state management.
